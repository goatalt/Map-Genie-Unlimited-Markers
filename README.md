# Map Genie Unlimited Markers

Unlimited https://mapgenie.io marked map locations without having to sign up for Pro!

This modified javascript file allows you to bypass the Map Genie Pro restriction on marked locations, allowing for more than 100 markers. 

This was created for those who are too poor to pay for Pro. Please consider just paying if you have the means, it's only 10 bucks and less steps than the directions below lol.

I was very bored the night that I made this, I even wrote all this stuff for the README. I don't know what I am doing with my life.
